/*
A line is a sequence of line notes. Chords / intervals
are only produced by simlatenously-sounding lines and are
not present in an individual line.
This class provides the general Line object as well as
operations to transform lines within the context of Tonal Theory.

Why not just have Line extend List so we
could easily do all the many operations SC allows?
Because there are operations on List that would break the invariants of what a Line is. Instead, Line encapsulates and tries to maintain those invariants.
